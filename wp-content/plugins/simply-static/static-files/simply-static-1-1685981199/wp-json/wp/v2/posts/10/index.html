US Defense Minister Austin Lloyd&#8217;s two-day visit to India held a detailed discussion on this issue on Monday.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After talks with India&#8217;s Defense Minister Rajnath Singh, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told media representatives, &#8216;The relationship between the two countries is improving rapidly. We are now looking at expanding the scope of defense industry cooperation.&#8217;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main objective of this cooperation in defense manufacturing is to make India &#8216;self-reliant&#8217; and implement the &#8216;Make in India&#8217; slogan. After the &#8216;warm and sincere&#8217; meeting of the two defense ministers, the statement of the Ministry of Defense of India said that policy guidelines have been prepared for how the two countries will expand the area of \u200b\u200bmutual cooperation in the next few years. Accordingly, the two countries will identify new technology-based defense production areas. Emphasis will also be placed on technology transfer to scale up production.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two leaders also discussed enhancing defense ties. After the meeting, Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said that it is important to keep India and the Pacific region under free, unfettered and legal governance and deepen the relationship between the two countries to ensure that. For that, India is ready to work more closely with the US to build strategic ties and enhance defense capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the visit, it was reported by informed sources that General Electric of the United States is interested in transferring the technology of manufacturing fighter aircraft engines to India. Apart from this, India has also shown interest in buying 30 &#8216;MQ-9B&#8217; armed drones from the US for $3 billion. These issues will be considered during the visit to Austin. However, after the meeting of the two ministers, nothing specific was said about it. However, it is believed that the US Defense Secretary&#8217;s visit is very indicative ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s upcoming US visit.<br>Russia supplies the bulk of India&#8217;s defense equipment and armaments. Despite that long-standing relationship, India has also started buying military weapons from the US, France and Israel over the years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before coming to India, Austin attended the &#8216;Sangri La Dialogue&#8217;, a security summit in Singapore. China&#8217;s Defense Minister Li Shangfu warned that the formation of a military alliance like &#8220;NATO&#8221; in the Asia-Pacific region will plunge the entire region into a whirlwind of conflict. The United States has taken steps to create a NATO-like military alliance in the region to counter China&#8217;s speculation. They are keen to include India in that alliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Rajnath Singh&#8217;s meeting with Austin discussed keeping the Indo-Pacific region &#8216;fear-free and free&#8217;, there was no word from any quarter on whether the proposal to form a military alliance like NATO was discussed or not. Lloyd Austin also held a meeting with India&#8217;s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>India and the US have jointly decided on a direction to move forward in expanding areas of cooperation in defense manufacturing and technology transfer.
