It is believed that such a decision has been taken to increase the price of oil in the world market by reducing the supply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement was made after a meeting between the 13-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its 10 allies led by Saudi Arabia. Russia led the Allies. OPEC and 10 allied countries are called OPEC Plus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told reporters that the decision to cut production was made for the month of July. Its duration may be extended.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to cut &#8216;voluntary&#8217; production was announced after representatives of OPEC plus countries took part in several hours of talks in the Austrian capital Vienna.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A source involved in this discussion says that there has been a discussion about reducing production by 1 million barrels per day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 60 percent of the world&#8217;s total oil is produced in OPEC plus countries. Oil-producing nations have struggled to cope with falling oil prices and volatile markets since Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last April, several OPEC Plus members agreed to voluntarily cut production by more than 1 million barrels a day. Although this sudden action reduced the price of oil, it was not sustainable for long.<br>Oil prices fell nearly 10 percent after announcing production cuts in April. Brent crude oil prices fell to $70 per barrel. This is the first time since December 2021 that the price of Brent crude has fallen so much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that the current decision to cut production may be extended until the end of 2024 after testing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Saudi Arabia has announced to reduce oil production by another 1 million barrels per day.
