<p>One question the football world has already answered is whether Lionel Messi&#8217;s two-year relationship with PSG has ended. There is also a question about Messi, which is now a question of billions of dollars in the football world &#8211; where will Messi go?</p>



<p>Al Hilal officials are currently in Paris, according to news agency AFP. They went there to talk to Messi&#8217;s father and agent Jorge Messi to finalize the deal. AFP wrote in their news that the official announcement of the finalization of the contract will be made by the Saudi Arabian club before the beginning of the week.</p>



<p>Even with such news, there is no shortage of expectations about Messi&#8217;s return to Barcelona. The club&#8217;s supporters at Camp Nou are still hoping that Messi will return. Messi signed from Barcelona to PSG in 2021. While AFP is reporting on the final stage of the contract with Al Hilal on the Argentine World Cup-winning star, journalists close to Barcelona are asking the president of the club, Juan Laporta, what is the probability of Messi&#8217;s return?</p>



<p>Laporta was asked this question yesterday by a journalist who turned on his cell phone recorder to record what Laporta said. Then Laporta showed a strange reaction.</p>



<p>According to Argentinian media TYC, Laporta grabbed the journalist&#8217;s phone and put it in his pocket. Then he said, &#8216;You will see if it is difficult to return Messi.&#8217; After a while, however, Laporta returned the journalist&#8217;s mobile phone.</p>
