<p>A record number of foreigners took up citizenship in Germany last year. This number is the highest in the last 20 years.</p>



<p>According to the government&#8217;s calculations, in 2022, 168,545 people from 171 countries of the world took German citizenship. This number is 28 percent more than the previous year, i.e. 2021.</p>



<p>Syrians top the list of foreigners granted citizenship. The average age of people who have taken German citizenship from the war-torn Middle Eastern country is 25 years (24.8). Two-thirds of them are men. They stayed in the country for an average of six and a half years (6.4) before getting citizenship.</p>



<p>Ukrainians are second in the list of German citizens. Thousands of Ukrainians fled the country after the Russian offensive began. A part of them took refuge in Germany.</p>



<p>In 2022, immigrants from Iraq, another war-torn country in the Middle East, ranked third among immigrants who received German citizenship. And the Turks are in the fourth position.</p>



<p>Ian Schneider, an expert at the Department of Integration and Migration, said that half of the Syrians who got citizenship got German citizenship within six years. The reason for this is that they have been able to show evidence of integration into German society.</p>



<p>According to Schleider, the German citizenship of Syrians will increase this year. Because, the current coalition government in power is working to simplify the citizenship law.</p>



<p>Currently, in order to obtain German citizenship, a candidate must demonstrate eight years of residence in Germany and proof of German language proficiency (B1 level). Along with passing a special written test for citizenship. Apart from this, there is a requirement to have the financial ability to operate without state aid and to have no criminal record.</p>



<p>However, due to the shortage of skilled workers in the country, the ruling coalition government led by Olaf Schultz is trying to amend the citizenship law. The government believes that easing citizenship laws will encourage skilled foreign workers to immigrate to the country.</p>



<p>Interior Minister Nancy Fesser&#8217;s proposed new citizenship law calls for three major changes.</p>



<p>Under the proposed new law, citizenship can be applied for after five years of legal residence in Germany instead of eight. Apart from this, there is an opportunity to apply after three years of residence if you can show proof of integration in the society.</p>



<p>If one of the parents of a child born in Germany has lived legally in the country for five years, the child is eligible for German citizenship.</p>



<p>Apart from this, it is said that the facility of holding dual citizenship is also being kept in the new law.</p>
